				  Super Bowl commercials have become an event and are arguably more entertaining than
					the game itself. Every year the lavish ads get even more absurd with bizarre concepts
					and over the top theatrics. With companies spending millions of dollars for seconds of
					airtime, I always look forward to what's next.
					<br><br>
					In the chart below, is an analysis of the top 3 mentions on Twitter each minute from
					6:00 pm to 10:00 pm during Super Bowl LIII on Sunday February 3rd 2019. Place your
					mouse over any of the data points to reveal the top 3 mentions for that minute.
